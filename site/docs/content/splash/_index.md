# Home-screen splash

When makima starts with no conversation, it shows the home screen: an animated starfield, the logo, a tagline, a tip, the help line, and the version in the top-right corner. All of it is drawn by the bundled `splashes_default` plugin (`plugins/splashes_default/splash/default.lua`, enabled by default), so you can replace or tweak any of it from your `init.lua` with no Rust rebuild and no new config.

Rust keeps the operationally sensitive pieces a plugin should not own: the frame clock, the repaint cadence, the entry-fade value, and the version/update check. The plugin answers a per-frame question with the pixels for the whole screen.

## The `splash.render` slot

Every time the splash is allowed to animate, the UI pulls a frame from the slot `splash.render` and blits it. The bundled `splashes_default` plugin owns the slot and renders the default screen. Your plugin can wrap it with `maki.api.set_slot("splash.render", ...)`.

```lua
maki.api.set_slot("splash.render", function(prev, w, h, t, fade)
  -- call prev(w, h, t, fade) to keep the default and tweak it,
  -- or ignore it to fully replace the screen.
  return my_frame(w, h, t, fade)
end)
```

The function receives:

- `w`, `h` the splash area size in cells
- `t` seconds since this splash session started
- `fade` 0 to 1, the entry-fade value Rust computes itself

It returns a table of `h` rows, each an array of segments. A segment is `{ glyphs = string, style = ... }`. The `glyphs` strings of a row concatenate to exactly `w` cells. Space characters are skipped by the blitter unless a segment carries an explicit style (explicit styles paint every char, spaces included, so they erase the starfield behind text).

The `style` is one of:

- `"field"` reuse the fixed `" .:+*"` wave-intensity LUT. Use one `"field"` segment per background row; the blitter colors each glyph from the accent palette.
- `"#rrggbb"` a foreground hex color.
- `{ fg = "#rrggbb", bold = false }` an explicit cell style. `fg` is optional: an omitted foreground renders with the host theme's foreground, and the cell background is always the host's theme background. Use this for text rows so the themed background keeps the starfield behind it as `[field lead, text, field tail]`.

A still splash is never animated: the cadence is `IDLE` after the entry fade, so `splash.render` stops being called. `ui.splash_animation = false` means a fading-in still splash that settles, not a frozen starfield. With it on, the starfield drifts at full frame rate.

## Who fades what

Rust computes `fade` and passes it down; the plugin owns applying it. The default folds `fade` into the starfield's intensity-to-glyph map (a dimmer cell shows a lower bucket, not a dimmed color) and bakes the per-element alphas into explicit text colors. Rust never fades a row. An override can apply `fade` the same way, or simply ignore it.

## Version and the update notice

Rust keeps running the update check. The result is mirrored into the Lua runtime, and plugins read it with `maki.version()`:

```lua
local v = maki.version()
-- v.current        string, e.g. "0.4.8"
-- v.latest         string | nil
-- v.update_available  boolean
```

The default plugin draws the top-right version text and, when an update exists, appends ` run makima update to get v<latest>`. It queries `maki.version()` inside `splash.render`, so the version UI is fully plugin-owned.

## Bundled splashes

The `splashes` plugin is the picker: it presents every splash registered in
the `splash` contribution registry as a switchable option, owns one stable
`splash.render` layer, and changes which registered renderer draws. The
bundled `splashes_default` plugin registers the default starfield under
`default` plus six ready-made splashes under the `splash.*` namespace. Use
`/splash` to preview and commit a choice, or `/splash <name>` for direct
selection. `/splash default` selects the standard starfield. Selecting
`default` draws the slot chain below the picker, so a user
`set_slot("splash.render", ...)` layer still applies to the starfield; a
named splash draws directly from the registry.

```lua
local kaleidoscope = require("splash.kaleidoscope")
local rows = kaleidoscope.render(w, h, t, fade)
```

| Module | What it draws |
|--------|---------------|
| `splash.kaleidoscope` | 10-fold mirror kaleidoscope over a circle-inversion fractal |
| `splash.voronoi` | animated voronoi cells with warm glowing borders |
| `splash.caustics` | deep-water light caustics |
| `splash.metaballs` | merging metaballs with a glow contour |
| `splash.aurora` | northern-light bands drifting over a night gradient |
| `splash.matrix` | green falling-code rain, resets on `SplashShown` |

Each module returns `M` with `M.description` and `M.render(w, h, t, fade)`
but does not activate itself; `splashes_default` wires every module into the
registry, and the picker's slot layer calls the registered renderer. A
custom layer can also rotate through the modules:

```lua
local splashes = {
  require("splash.kaleidoscope"),
  require("splash.aurora"),
}
maki.api.set_slot("splash.render", function(prev, w, h, t, fade)
  local splash = splashes[(math.floor(t / 3) % #splashes) + 1]
  return splash.render(w, h, t, fade)
end)
```

Bundled modules resolve before files in the config `lua/` dir, so personal splashes must use plain names such as `require("mysplash")` outside the `splash.*` namespace. The bundled splashes live in `plugins/splashes_default/splash/` in the repository and follow the same single-file pattern as the custom splashes below.

Third-party plugins can add entries to the same registry with `maki.store.register`. An entry is a table with a `label`, a `description`, and a `renderer` function. Entries are removed automatically when their plugin unloads, and the `StoreChanged` event tells the picker to re-resolve, so it does not retain a function from an old plugin instance.

```lua
local mysplash = require("mysplash")

maki.store.register("splash", "mysplash", {
  label = "My splash",
  description = "A short description",
  renderer = mysplash.render,
})
```

The picker validates a selection before it persists the selection. If an active renderer fails later, the picker switches to the previous renderer and repairs the persisted selection asynchronously. Invalid or unavailable persisted entries fall back to the `default` splash. Selections made with `persist = false` never touch the file.

## Choosing a splash at startup

The picker takes a `splash` option: the splash to select when makima boots. It wins over the persisted selection and updates it to the option's value, so it is a declarative default that re-wins on every boot; `/splash` can still override it at runtime.

```lua
maki.setup({
  plugins = {
    splashes = { splash = "aurora" },
  },
})
```

The name resolves once the registry has it: a bundled name is applied before the first frame, and a splash you registered in `init.lua` itself is applied at load time. An unknown name falls back to the `default` splash with a flash, and nothing is persisted.

## Switching splashes programmatically

Any Lua context can select a splash by firing the `SplashSelect` autocmd. The picker commits it with the same rules as `/splash`: it validates the renderer, persists the choice, and rolls back if the renderer fails later.

```lua
maki.api.exec_autocmds("SplashSelect", { data = { name = "aurora" } })
```

`data` needs `name` (the registry key). The optional `persist` flag (default `true`) skips the persisted selection, which is what a temporary switch wants.

## Lifecycle events

`SplashShown` fires when the home screen appears (startup, and after returning to it). `SplashHidden` fires when it goes away, once the first message or turn lands. A plugin uses these to reset per-show state, like picking a fresh tip or clearing matrix-rain columns:

```lua
maki.api.create_autocmd("SplashShown", {
  callback = function()
    -- reset anything that should start fresh each time the home screen shows
  end,
})
```

## Matrix rain: a whole-screen override

This is a complete `init.lua` override. It ignores `prev` because it replaces the whole screen, keeps its own per-width column state, resets on `SplashShown`, and draws the version itself in the top-right to show that plugins own that corner too.

```lua
local GLYPHS = "!<>-_\\/[]{}=+*^?#"

local state = { cols = {}, last_t = 0 }

local function reset(w)
  local c = {}
  for x = 1, w do
    c[x] = { y = math.random(-20, 0), speed = 0.15 + math.random() * 0.35 }
  end
  state.cols[w] = c
end

maki.api.create_autocmd("SplashShown", { callback = function() state.cols = {} end })

local function drop_glyph()
  return string.sub(GLYPHS, math.random(1, #GLYPHS), math.random(1, #GLYPHS))
end

local function matrix_frame(w, h, t, fade)
  if not state.cols[w] then reset(w) end
  local dt = math.max(0, t - state.last_t)
  state.last_t = t

  local grid = {}
  for _ = 1, h do grid[#grid + 1] = {} end
  for x = 1, w do
    local c = state.cols[w][x]
    c.y = c.y + c.speed * dt
    local head = math.floor(c.y)
    for k = 0, 5 do
      local yy = head - k
      if yy >= 1 and yy <= h then
        local fg = "#00ff41"
        if k == 0 then fg = "#c8ffd0" elseif k > 1 then fg = "#005c17" end
        grid[yy][x] = { ch = drop_glyph(), fg = fg }
      end
    end
  end

  -- a title line and the version, proving text + version are plugin-owned
  local title = "matrix rain"
  local v = maki.version()
  local vs = "v" .. v.current

  local rows = {}
  for y = 1, h do
    local segs, buf = {}, {}
    for x = 1, w do
      if grid[y][x] and (y ~= h - 4) and x ~= (w - #vs) then
        if #buf > 0 then
          segs[#segs + 1] = { glyphs = table.concat(buf), style = { bold = false } }
          buf = {}
        end
        segs[#segs + 1] = { glyphs = grid[y][x].ch, style = { fg = grid[y][x].fg, bold = false } }
      else
        buf[#buf + 1] = " "
      end
    end
    segs[#segs + 1] = { glyphs = table.concat(buf), style = { bold = false } }
    if y == h - 4 then
      segs[1] = { glyphs = string.rep(" ", math.floor((w - #title) / 2)), style = { bold = false } }
      segs[2] = { glyphs = title, style = { fg = "#00ff41", bold = true } }
    elseif y == 1 then
      segs[1] = { glyphs = string.rep(" ", w - #vs - 1), style = { bold = false } }
      segs[2] = { glyphs = vs, style = { fg = "#00ff41", bold = false } }
    end
    rows[y] = segs
  end
  return rows
end

maki.api.set_slot("splash.render", function(prev, w, h, t, fade)
  return matrix_frame(w, h, t, fade)
end)
```

Two notes on writing overrides:

- The renderer must be pure and pull-driven. It runs on the Lua thread while the UI waits for the frame, so do not call blocking maki API from inside it (for example an `open_win` that waits on the UI would deadlock). The default and the example above only read `maki.version()` and theme colors.
- A full replace only works while the bundled `splashes_default` plugin stays enabled, so `splash.render` keeps its default. Wrapping with `prev(...)` lets a layer tweak the default instead of replacing it.
